## 🚀 STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR REPOSITORY

### **1.1 Create Developer Branch**
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "/Users/danielsutton/Desktop/Frontend Versions/jewelia-crm-backup-20250806-173139 (2)"

# Create a safe development branch
git checkout -b sandbox-development
git push -u origin sandbox-development

# Create developer's specific branch
git checkout -b developer/[developer-name]/section-access
git push -u origin developer/[developer-name]/section-access
```

### **1.2 Set Up GitHub Security**
1. Go to: https://github.com/danielsutton1/jewelry-crm-sandbox/settings
2. Click "Branches" → "Add rule"
3. Protect `main` branch (require pull requests)
4. Protect `sandbox-development` branch (require pull requests)

---

## 🎯 STEP 2: GIVE SECTION-SPECIFIC ACCESS

### **2.1 Example: Give Access to Customers Section**

**What you'll do:**
- Give developer access to ONLY the customers section
- They can work on customer management, profiles, orders
- They cannot access other sections

**Step-by-step process:**

#### **A. Create Section-Specific Branch**
```bash
# Create branch for customers section work
git checkout sandbox-development
git checkout -b developer/[developer-name]/customers-section

# Push the branch
git push -u origin developer/[developer-name]/customers-section
```

#### **B. Tell Developer What They Can Access**
Send this message to your developer:

```

## 🔍 STEP 3: MONITOR THEIR WORK DAILY

### **3.1 Daily Check Script**
Create this script to monitor their work:

```bash
# Create daily monitoring script
cat > check_developer_work.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 CHECKING DEVELOPER WORK - $(date)"
echo "=================================="

# Check what they worked on today
echo "📊 TODAY'S COMMITS:"
git log --author="[developer-email]" --since="yesterday" --oneline

echo ""
echo "📁 FILES THEY CHANGED:"
git log --author="[developer-email]" --since="yesterday" --name-only

echo ""
echo "🔍 DETAILED CHANGES:"
git log --author="[developer-email]" --since="yesterday" --stat

echo ""
echo "⚠️  SECURITY CHECK:"
echo "Checking if they stayed in their assigned area..."
git log --author="[developer-email]" --since="yesterday" --name-only | grep -E "(customers|sales|orders|inventory)" || echo "❌ They worked outside their assigned area!"

echo ""
echo "✅ SAFE AREAS CHECK:"
git log --author="[developer-email]" --since="yesterday" --name-only | grep -E "(customers)" && echo "✅ Working in customers section" || echo "❌ Not working in assigned area"
EOF

chmod +x check_developer_work.sh
```

### **3.2 Run Daily Check**
```bash
# Run this every day at 5 PM
./check_developer_work.sh
```

---

## 📋 STEP 4: REVIEW THEIR WORK

### **4.1 When Developer Says "Ready for Review"**

#### **A. Check Their Work**
```bash
# Switch to their branch
git checkout developer/[developer-name]/customers-section

# Pull their latest changes
git pull origin developer/[developer-name]/customers-section

# Start the app to test
npm run dev
```

#### **B. Test the Customers Section**
1. Open browser to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/customers
2. Test all customer functionality:
   - [ ] Customer list loads properly
   - [ ] Add new customer works
   - [ ] Edit customer works
   - [ ] Customer orders display correctly
   - [ ] Mobile view works on phone
   - [ ] All buttons and forms work
   - [ ] No errors in browser console

#### **C. Check What They Changed**
```bash

git diff sandbox-development..developer/[developer-name]/customers-section

# See specific changes
git show --stat
```

---

## ✅ STEP 5: APPROVE OR REJECT WORK

### **5.1 If Work is GOOD (Approve)**

#### **A. Test Everything One More Time**
```bash
# Make sure everything works
npm run build
npm run dev

# Test on mobile device

```

#### **B. Merge Their Work**
```bash
# Switch to sandbox-development
git checkout sandbox-development

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin sandbox-development

# Merge their work
git merge developer/[developer-name]/customers-section

# Push to repository
git push origin sandbox-development

# Create backup
git tag "backup-customers-section-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
git push origin --tags
```

#### **C. Tell Developer**
```
✅ APPROVED! Great work on the customers section!

Your changes have been merged and saved. 

Next steps:

- Wait for next assignment

Thanks for the excellent work!
```

### **5.2 If Work is BAD (Request Changes)**

#### **A. Document the Issues**
```
❌ NEEDS CHANGES

I found some issues with the customers section:

ISSUES FOUND:

3. Error messages are not clear
4. Page loads slowly

PLEASE FIX:
- Test on mobile devices
