2. **Test Suite Failures**: 39% test failure rate
3. **Schema Mismatches**: Data integrity issues
4. **Missing Dependencies**: Playwright not installed for E2E tests
5. **Environment Configuration**: Some environment variables not properly configured

### High Priority Issues
1. **Data Consistency**: Frontend-backend data model mismatches
2. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling across components
3. **Performance**: Unoptimized queries and components
4. **Security**: Some RLS policies need review
5. **Monitoring**: Limited error tracking and monitoring

---

## 6. Detailed Findings

- Frontend expects `images` column in products table
- Some API responses don't match frontend interfaces

#### Test Suite Failures
- 41 out of 104 tests failing
- Integration tests failing due to data mismatches
- Component tests failing due to missing props

### 6.2 High Priority Issues

#### Data Flow Problems
- `filteredInventory.map is not a function` errors
- Missing data validation in components
- Inconsistent error handling

#### Performance Issues
- Unoptimized database queries
- Missing indexes on frequently queried columns
- Large bundle sizes due to unoptimized imports

#### Security Concerns
- Some RLS policies may be too permissive
- Missing input sanitization in some areas
- Inconsistent permission validation

### 6.3 Medium Priority Issues

#### Code Quality
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing TypeScript types in some areas
- Incomplete test coverage

#### User Experience
- Loading states not properly handled
- Error messages not user-friendly
- Inconsistent UI patterns

## 10. Conclusion

The Jewelia CRM system has a solid architectural foundation with modern technologies and good separation of concerns. However, several critical issues prevent it from being production-ready:

1. **WebRTC integration is completely broken**
2. **Significant data model mismatches between frontend and backend**
3. **High test failure rate indicates integration problems**
4. **Missing critical production features**

### Estimated Time to Production Ready: 2-3 weeks

**Priority Order:**
1. Fix WebRTC integration (1 week)
2. Resolve schema mismatches (1 week)
3. Fix test suite and add monitoring (1 week)

### Final Recommendation

**DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until all critical issues are resolved. The system needs significant work before it can safely serve real users.
