# 🔐 GITHUB AUTHENTICATION SETUP
## You need to authenticate with GitHub to push your code

## 🚨 CURRENT ISSUE:
GitHub is rejecting your push because you're not authenticated. This is normal and expected for security.

## 🎯 SOLUTION OPTIONS:

### **OPTION 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Jewelry CRM Development"
4. Set expiration: "No expiration" (or 1 year)
5. Select scopes:
   - ✅ repo (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ workflow (Update GitHub Action workflows)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

### **OPTION 2: GitHub CLI (Easier)**
1. Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh`
2. Run: `gh auth login`
3. Follow the prompts to authenticate

### **OPTION 3: SSH Key (Most Secure)**
1. Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "danielsutton1@gmail.com"`
2. Add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/ssh/new
3. Test connection: `ssh -T git@github.com`

## 🚀 AFTER AUTHENTICATION:

Once you're authenticated, run:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
