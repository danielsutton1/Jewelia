# 🏗️ Complete Sandbox Setup Guide

## ✅ What We've Done

Your code has been prepared for the development sandbox with:
- ✅ Environment variable templates
- ✅ Development-specific configurations
- ✅ Security guidelines
- ✅ Contribution guidelines
- ✅ Sensitive data removed
- ✅ Proper documentation

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. **Repository name:** `jewelry-crm-sandbox`
4. **Description:** "Development sandbox for Jewelia CRM"
5. **Make it PRIVATE** ⚠️
6. **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Code to Sandbox
```bash
# Add the sandbox as a remote
git remote add sandbox https://github.com/danielsutton1/jewelry-crm-sandbox.git

# Push your current code to the sandbox
git push sandbox messaging-system-fixes

# Create a main branch in the sandbox
git checkout -b main
git push sandbox main

# Create a develop branch for ongoing work
git checkout -b develop
git push sandbox develop
```

### Step 3: Set Up Branch Protection
1. Go to your sandbox repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" → "Branches"
3. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews
   - ✅ Require status checks
   - ✅ Restrict pushes to main branch
4. Add rule for `develop` branch:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews
   - ✅ Allow force pushes (for development)

### Step 4: Configure Developer Access
1. Go to "Settings" → "Manage access"
2. Click "Invite a collaborator"
3. Add your developer's GitHub username
4. Set permission to "Write" (not "Admin")
5. They'll receive an invitation email

### Step 5: Set Up Development Database
1. Create a new Supabase project for development
2. Copy the development credentials to `.env.development`
3. Run your database migration scripts
4. Add sample data for testing

## 🔐 Security Checklist

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Remove all production API keys
- [ ] Use development Supabase project
- [ ] Set up development email service
- [ ] Use development payment keys (if applicable)

### Access Control
- [ ] Repository is private
- [ ] Developer has "Write" access only
- [ ] Branch protection rules enabled
- [ ] Code review required for main branch

### Monitoring
- [ ] Enable GitHub Actions for automated testing
- [ ] Set up notifications for pull requests
- [ ] Monitor all developer activity
- [ ] Regular security audits

## 🛠️ Developer Workflow

### For Your Developer:
1. **Clone the sandbox:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danielsutton1/jewelry-crm-sandbox.git
   cd jewelry-crm-sandbox
   ```

2. **Set up environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Fill in development values
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/their-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make changes and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description"
   git push origin feature/their-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create pull request:**
   - Go to GitHub repository
   - Click "New pull request"
   - Select their feature branch → develop
   - Add description and request review

### For You (Project Owner):
1. **Review pull requests:**
   - Check code quality
   - Test functionality
   - Ensure security standards
   - Provide feedback

2. **Merge approved changes:**
   - Approve pull request
   - Merge to develop branch
   - Test in sandbox environment

3. **Deploy to production:**
   - Create pull request: develop → main
   - Review and merge
   - Deploy to production

## 📋 Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Updates
- [ ] Weekly: Review developer activity
- [ ] Monthly: Update sandbox with production changes
- [ ] Quarterly: Security audit and dependency updates

### Code Synchronization
```bash
# Update sandbox with latest production changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push sandbox develop
```

## 🚨 Important Security Notes

1. **Never give developers access to production repository**
2. **Always review code before merging to production**
3. **Use separate development database and services**
4. **Monitor all developer activity and changes**
5. **Regularly update sandbox with latest production code**
