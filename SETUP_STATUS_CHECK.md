# 🔍 CURRENT SETUP STATUS CHECK
## What you have vs. what you need

## ✅ WHAT YOU HAVE:
- ✅ Complete jewelry CRM codebase locally
- ✅ All developer management guides created
- ✅ GitHub repository: https://github.com/danielsutton1/jewelry-crm-sandbox
- ✅ All necessary scripts and templates ready

## ❌ WHAT YOU'RE MISSING:
- ❌ Git repository not initialized locally
- ❌ Local code not connected to GitHub
- ❌ No branches set up for developer work
- ❌ GitHub security settings not configured

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ISSUE:
Your local code is NOT connected to GitHub yet. This means:
- Developer can't access your code
- No version control
- No safe development workflow
- Can't use any of the management guides

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS NEEDED:
1. Initialize Git repository locally
2. Connect to GitHub repository
3. Set up branches for developer work
4. Configure GitHub security
5. Test the connection

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:
You need to do this setup BEFORE you can onboard a developer!
