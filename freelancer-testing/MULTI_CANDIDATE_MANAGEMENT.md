# ðŸ‘¥ **MULTI-CANDIDATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

## **How to Manage Multiple Candidates Working on Challenges**

### **Strategy 1: Individual Repository Forks (Recommended)**

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Each candidate forks your repository**
2. **They work in their own fork**
3. **You can track progress individually**
4. **Easy to compare solutions**

#### **Setup Process:**
1. **Candidate forks repository**: `https://github.com/danielsutton1/jewelry-crm-freelancer-testing`
2. **They work in their fork**: `https://github.com/CANDIDATE_NAME/jewelry-crm-freelancer-testing`
3. **They submit pull request** when complete
4. **You review each solution individually**

#### **Benefits:**
- âœ… **Complete isolation** between candidates
- âœ… **Easy to track** who did what
- âœ… **Version control** for each candidate
- âœ… **Can see commit history** and progress
- âœ… **Easy to compare** solutions side-by-side

---

### **Strategy 2: Branch-Based System**

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Each candidate gets their own branch**
2. **They work in their branch**
3. **You can switch between branches**
4. **Easy to manage and compare**

#### **Setup Process:**
1. **Add candidate as collaborator** (read/write access)
2. **Create branch for each candidate**: `candidate-john-doe`, `candidate-jane-smith`
3. **Each candidate works in their branch**
4. **You review branches individually**

#### **Benefits:**
- âœ… **All in one repository**
- âœ… **Easy to switch between candidates**
- âœ… **Can see all progress in one place**
- âœ… **Easy to compare solutions**

---

### **Strategy 3: Separate Repositories (Most Secure)**

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Create separate repository for each candidate**
2. **Give them access to their own repository**
3. **Complete isolation**
4. **Maximum security**

#### **Setup Process:**
1. **Create new repository**: `jewelry-crm-candidate-john-doe`
2. **Copy all files** from main repository
3. **Give candidate access** to their repository
4. **They work in their own space**

#### **Benefits:**
- âœ… **Maximum security** and isolation
- âœ… **No risk of candidates seeing each other's work**
- âœ… **Complete control** over access
- âœ… **Easy to manage** individual progress

## **RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Strategy 1 (Forks)**

### **Why Forks Are Best:**
- **Easy to set up** - candidates just fork your repo
- **Complete isolation** - each candidate has their own copy
- **Easy to track** - you can see all forks in your repository
- **Professional workflow** - standard GitHub practice
- **Easy to compare** - you can view multiple forks side-by-side

### **How to Implement:**

#### **Step 1: Update Your Job Post**
Add this to your Upwork job post:
```
## How to Apply:
1. Fork this repository: https://github.com/danielsutton1/jewelry-crm-freelancer-testing
2. Complete all 5 challenges in your fork
3. Submit a pull request when complete
4. Include your Upwork profile link in the pull request
```

#### **Step 2: Track Candidates**
- **GitHub will show you all forks** of your repository
- **Each fork will have the candidate's GitHub username**
- **You can visit each fork** to see their progress
- **Pull requests will show** when they're done

#### **Step 3: Evaluate Solutions**
- **Review each fork individually**
- **Use the evaluation guide** to score each candidate
- **Compare solutions** side-by-side
- **Make hiring decision** based on scores

## **CANDIDATE TRACKING SYSTEM**

### **Create a Tracking Spreadsheet:**

| Candidate | GitHub Username | Fork URL | Status | Score | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| John Doe | johndoe123 | https://github.com/johndoe123/jewelry-crm-freelancer-testing | In Progress | - | Started Challenge 1 |
| Jane Smith | janesmith456 | https://github.com/janesmith456/jewelry-crm-freelancer-testing | Complete | 85% | Excellent solutions |
| Bob Johnson | bobjohnson789 | https://github.com/bobjohnson789/jewelry-crm-freelancer-testing | Not Started | - | Applied but hasn't started |

### **Status Tracking:**
- **Not Started**: Candidate applied but hasn't forked repository
- **In Progress**: Candidate has forked and is working on challenges
- **Complete**: Candidate has submitted pull request
- **Under Review**: You're evaluating their solutions
- **Hired**: Candidate selected for the project
- **Rejected**: Candidate not selected

---

## **EVALUATION WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Initial Review**
1. **Check if candidate forked repository**
2. **Verify they're working on challenges**
3. **Monitor their progress** (commit history)

### **Step 2: Solution Review**
1. **Review each challenge solution**
2. **Use evaluation guide** to score
3. **Check for AI vs manual coding**
4. **Assess code quality**

### **Step 3: Comparison**
1. **Compare solutions** side-by-side
2. **Rank candidates** by score
3. **Consider communication** and professionalism
4. **Make final decision**

## **SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS**

### **What's Safe:**
- âœ… **Repository is private** - only you can see it
- âœ… **Candidates work in their own forks** - isolated from each other
- âœ… **No access to your main codebase** - only test challenges
- âœ… **Can revoke access** at any time

### **Additional Security:**
- **Don't give access to main repository**
- **Only share the fork link**
- **Monitor who forks your repository**
- **Set clear boundaries** on what they can access

---

## **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Track These Metrics:**
- **Number of applications received**
- **Number of candidates who forked repository**
- **Number of candidates who completed challenges**
- **Average completion time**
- **Quality of solutions received**

### **Expected Results:**
- **10-20 applications** for a good job post
- **5-10 candidates** will actually fork and start
- **3-5 candidates** will complete all challenges
- **1-2 candidates** will score 80%+ and be interview-worthy
